A Utility AI implementation for the Godot Engine using gdextension.

## Node listing

* *UtilityAIAgent* This is the main node that is used manage the UtilityAI. It represents an AI entity.
* *UtilityAIBehaviour* The various things the AI agent can do are called _behaviours_. Each Behaviour consists of _considerations_ and _actions_.
* *UtilityAIConsideration* The AI agent does it's reasoning on what behaviour to use by going through its considerations and producing a score for each behaviour. This node is used to represent a single thing the AI Agent should consider about a behaviour. A consideration uses a _sensor_ for input data.
* *UtilityAIConsiderationGroup* Several considerations can be grouped to create more complex or high-level logic.
* *UtilityAISensor* The sensor node is used to update input data to the AI Agent's considerations.
* *UtilityAISensorGroup* Several sensors can be grouped for more high-level sensor input to the considerations.
* *UtilityAIAction* A behaviour, if selected, will run any actions attached to it.
* *UtilityAIActionGroup* Groups can help organize how a behaviour will run the actions attached to it.
