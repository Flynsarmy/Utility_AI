		This node type is used to create fallbacks.
		The [UtilityAIBTSelector] node executes its child nodes from top-to-bottom order until one of them succeeds (returning [code]1[/code]) or all of them fail (returning [code]-1[/code]). If a child returns running (0) the selector will return running to its parent.
		The [UtilityAIBTRandomSelector] works similarly, it just shuffles the nodes into a random order before ticking them.
